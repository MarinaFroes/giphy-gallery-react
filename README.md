# Giphy gallery
![](./src/images/giphyGallery.gif)

## Introduction

- This project consists of a single-page app created using React.
- The home page shows trending Gif images from Giphy and a search bar that allows the user to search for different gifs.

## Implementation requirements

 - [x] Avoid the urge to use jQuery if possible.
 - [x] Include an input field at the top which accepts a search word.  
 - [x] Submitting the form triggers a search on the Giphy API which returns the list of matching Gif images.
 - [x] Think about how to handle loading states and errors.
 - [x] Include a brief README file so we can easily run this locally.
 - [x] Do not upload it to a public repo.
 - [x] Try to complete the task within 2â€“4 hours
